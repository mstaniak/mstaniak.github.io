I am a PhD student at the Institute of Mathematics, University of Wrocław, where I am working on topics related to applications of statistics in proteomics. 
My advisors are [Małgorzata Bogdan](http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~mbogdan/) and [Tomasz Burzykowski](https://www.uhasselt.be/fiche_en?email=tomasz.burzykowski).

At the Institute of Mathematics, I teach an [introductory course in R](https://github.com/mstaniak/PiADwR), [advanced R course](https://github.com/mstaniak/SoftwareDev_R) and [some statistics](https://usosweb.uni.wroc.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2%2Fosoby%2FpokazOsobe&os_id=162998&lang=en). 

Through my second advisor, I am associated with [Center for Statistics@UHasselt](https://www.uhasselt.be/censtat). With researchers from CenStat, I work on topics in protein quantification.

I am also a software engineer for the [MSstats](https://github.com/MeenaChoi/MSstats) package in [Olga Vitek's lab](https://olga-vitek-lab.ccis.northeastern.edu/). 

My interests interests:
* applied statistics & biostatistics - particularly in proteomics,
* statistical software development,
* high-dimensional data analysis.
