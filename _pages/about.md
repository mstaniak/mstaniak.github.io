I am a PhD student at the Institute of Mathematics, University of Wrocław, where I am working on topics related to applications of statistics in proteomics. 
My advisors are [Małgorzata Bogdan](http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~mbogdan/) and [Tomasz Burzykowski](https://www.uhasselt.be/fiche_en?email=tomasz.burzykowski).

At the Institute of Mathematics, I teach an [introductory course in R](https://mstaniak.github.io/teaching/2019-fall-R) and I [help students who want to learn R programming and data analysis](https://github.com/StatsIMUWr/R_Workshops).

Through my second advisor, I am associated with [Center for Statistics@UHasselt](https://www.uhasselt.be/censtat). With researchers from CenStat, I work on topics in protein quantification.

I am also a software engineer for the [MSstats](https://github.com/MeenaChoi/MSstats) package in [Olga Vitek's lab](https://olga-vitek-lab.ccis.northeastern.edu/), I also collaborate with the [Mass Spectrometry Lab@IBB PAS](https://github.com/hadexversum/).

My interests focus around
* applied statistics & biostatistics - particularly in proteomics,
* statistical software development,
* feature selection,
* automation in data exploration.
